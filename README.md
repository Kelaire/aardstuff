## Aardwolf Plugins

These are my various plugins I've create for aardwolf

- AutoXStatus - Miniwindow to display a few of the "auto" statuses useful for epics (autoloot, autosac, autopk, autoass)
- EnemyStatus - Miniwindow to display just the enemy name and % you are fighting
- newbie_greeter - Sends a random greeting to the newbie channel to the new Aardwolf Player (not automated, still must issue commands!!)
- ocplugin - Oradrin's Chosen helper
- WhatRoom - Display the ID of the room you are currently in in a miniwindow
